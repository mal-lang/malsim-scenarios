# Ideal strategy:
# Do nothing until attacker reaches Application:0, then shut it down.

# Waiting defender leads to reward: -8055

# DFS defender leads to reward -32059

# BFS defender leads to reward -31072

# Defender running Application:0:notPresent
# when attacker reached SoftwareVulnerability:3:attemptAbuse
# leads to reward: -44
